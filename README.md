# CULT Evidence Links Microservice

The CULT Evidence Links Microservice allows you to upload your evidence photos to [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/README.md) and to receive an IPFS Hash / Link which you can add as evidence link when you submit your Acts of Revolt.

This microservice shall also inspire people to run an IPFS node. This is pretty easy via [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/blob/main/README.md). There shall be an incentive system to pin cult evidence links on one's ipfs node. I do not know how sophisticated [FileCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/) is when it comes to incentivizing such things in sustainable ways. The [arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) could turn out to be a plan b according to my current assumptions.  

Everyone is invited to support the emergence of manifold architectures of freedom by contributing to this repository.

In order to strengthen resilience, scalability and technological freedom for contributors, we establish a microservices architecture.

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).

### Start Locally
To start the backend server locally you might execute:  

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-net --allow-write --allow-env backend/server.ts 8042
```

### Start in Production
```sh
pm2 start backend/server.ts --interpreter="deno" --interpreter-args="run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net" -- 443
```
